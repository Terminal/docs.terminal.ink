The chosen file depth determines the file depth.</p>\n<p>The more bits per pixel, the greater the colour depth.\nDecreasing the bits per pixel makes the image look posterised.</p>\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\n<p>The resolution is the number of pixels that an image has.\nA higher resolution image can store more image detail.</p>\n<h3>Alpha</h3>\n<p>As well as RGB, a fourth channel \"Alpha\" may be included for transparency.</p>\n<h3>Metadata</h3>\n<p>Metadata is information stored in the file about the data itself.\nThis data describes the format of the file, the resolution, the colour depth, etc.\nThis is usually encoded in the file using the Exif metadata standard.</p>\n<p>Information that can be encoded includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aperture</li>\n<li>GPS</li>\n<li>Make and model of camera</li>\n<li>Height</li>\n<li>Width</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>File Size</h3>\n<p>\\({Width \\times Height \\times Bit Depth \\over 8} + Metadata = Size\\) (In Bytes)</p>\n<p>Max non-compressed crap storage format</p>\n<h2>4.5.6.5 Vector Graphics</h2>\n<p>A vector graphic is made of mathematic instructions.</p>\n<p>Geometrical primitives include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>points</li>\n<li>lines</li>\n<li>curves</li>\n<li>shapes</li>\n<li>polygons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BÃ©zier curves allow magical curves to appear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/circletine.svg\" alt=\"Circletine\"></p>\n<h2>4.5.6.6 Vector Graphics vs Bitmapped Graphics</h2>\n<p>Vector graphics are significantly smaller in size, but are primitive.\nBecause vector graphics are calculated, scaling is possible at any size.

A microphone records an analog signal, and a DAC converts it into a digital signal.</p>\n<p>Advantages of a digital signal</p>\n<div class=\"to-vscode\">\n+ Can copy without loss of data\n- Not exactly the original sound\n</div>\n<h3>Frequency</h3>\n<p>CDs use 44.1 kHz as this is two times 20kHz, the maximum frequency that the human ear can hear. This is to record both the peak and trouch of the wave, so give a close representation of the true sound.</p>\n<h3>Bit Depth</h3>\n<p>The bit depth determines the range of volumes storable for each sample. If you have a low sampling resolution (bit depth) then the rangew of volumes will be very limited, if you have a high sampling resolution (bit depth) then the file size may become unfeasible. The sampling resolution (bit depth) for a CD is 16 bits per sample.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bit Depth</th>\n<th>Usually...</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>CD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>DVD</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Bit Rate</h3>\n<p>The bit rate of a file tells us how many bits of data are processed every second. Bit rates are usually measured in kilobits per second (kbps).</p>\n<h4>Calculating bit rate</h4>\n<p>The bit rate is calculated using the formula:</p>\n<p>\\(frequency * bit depth * channels = bit rate\\)</p>\n<p>For example, the file size of an audio file that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lasts for 5 minutes</li>\n<li>Has a sample rate of 411000 samples per second</li>\n<li>Has a bit depth of 24 bits</li>\n<li>Is stereo</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"to-vscode\">\n591840000 ........
