# "This bot is private" when inviting Bots
When inviting a bot, you may encounter the following screen:

![An image of the "This bot is private" screen](/assets/images/invite/private.png)

This is caused by the owner of the bot misconfiguring the configuration of their bot.

You will therefore not be able to invite the bot.

## For bot owners
Go onto the Discord Developers page, and check the "Public Bot" option.
This will rectify the problem your users have inviting your bot.
