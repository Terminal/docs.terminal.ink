# No servers when inviting Bots
When inviting a bot, your dropdown box may be empty, like the following image:

![An empty Discord dropdown box](/assets/images/invite/no_servers.png)

This can mean one of many things:

- [You do not have adequate permissions to invite the bot](#fixing-permissions)
- [You are logged in to the wrong Discord user account _**within the web browser**_](#switching-accounts)

There are no other reasons why this error occurs.

## "But I am an owner - Look I have a role!"
Please ask the person with the crown icon to follow the [Fixing Permissions](#fixing-permissions) step.  
The user with the crown is the actual owner.

## Fixing permissions
**Please contact your server administrator for permission.**

The server administrator will need to follow the following steps:

1. Enable the "Manage Server" permission

2. Give a user the role which you enabled "Manage Server" on

## Switching accounts
1. Log out, by navigating to [https://discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com)
2. Open Discord
3. Click user settings, and log out
4. Log back in, and go back to the bot you were trying to add
