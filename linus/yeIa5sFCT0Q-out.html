      <p>I think it looks pretty good too. And you know what else looks good?
Tunnelbear’s VPN service.</p>

<p>It takes all the hassle on port forwarding and all that nonsense that quite frankly, even if you did feel like teaching your mother how to do, she’d end up calling you over and over again asking how to do it again and again and again and you’d be like: mum I just <em>mild seizures</em> install TunnelBear; and then that way if you want to browse the internet as though you’re from the United States or Britain or, wherever else; They support 20 different countries and all you do is hit the dial and you appear as though you are from that country.</p>

<p>They use encryption, they make it that your IP address get abstracted from the websites or services you’re using, and they give you access to websites and services that you otherwise would not be able to access, just because of the place you live.
I mean come on is that right in today’s connected internet world? And the best thing about TunnelBear is that it is absolutely free for the first 500 megabytes, then plans start at just a few bucks a month for unlimited data just like that.</p>

<p>They’ve got an application for Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, they even have a Chrome Extension, so pretty much you name a device a device, you can BearTunnel through it, which I’m sure made sense to somewhere somewhere, and if you’re having trouble with TunnelBear, their friendly support bears will be happy to help you, we’ve got a link in the video description, and also in this beautiful lower third that presumably someone has put down here, and that’s pretty much all that’s there to it.</p>

<p>Check it out today.</p>
