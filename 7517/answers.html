  <li>Explain what is meant by system software
    <ul>
      <li>System software is software that runs the operating system, utilities for the system and drivers which runs the computer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explain what is meant by application software
    <ul>
      <li>Application software is “every day” software that is not part of system software, such as word processing software, image manipulation software and web browsers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is general purpose software and discuss the pros and cons associated to it
    <ul>
      <li>General purpose application software is software that is designed to perform multiple “general” tasks around a “general” category, such as a word processing software being able to make emails, letters, mail merge and more.</li>
      <li>Advantages</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>It is relatively cheap</li>
      <li>Readily available</li>
      <li>Great support</li>
      <li>Less bugs as more people have tested the software
      - Disadvantages</li>
      <li>May not be specific enough</li>
      <li>May be more expensive in the long term, if subscription based</li>
      <li>Can’t fix yourself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is special purpose application software and discuss the pros and cons associated to it
    <ul>
      <li>Special purpose application software is software that is designed to perform a range of tasks in a single category, such as student register programs.</li>
      <li>Advantages</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Built for purpose</li>
      <li>Has less unnecessary bulk that is not required for the task
      - Disadvantages</li>
      <li>More expensive</li>
      <li>May need training, as the software is uncommon</li>
      <li>More bugs as less people have tested the software</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is bespoke application software and discuss the pros and cons associated to it
    <ul>
      <li>Bespoke application software is software built for a specific person and/or business for only the required task, such as a <a href="https://ls.terminal.ink/">Discord Bot List</a> (<em>cross promo</em>)</li>
      <li>Advantages</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Built for purpose</li>
      <li>Can be designed the way the person and/or business likes it to
        <ul>
          <li>Can include “House Style” colours and/or design</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Can quickly remove bugs that may be included, as the time taken to contact developers is decreased
      - Disadvantages</li>
      <li>Most expensive to develop and deploy</li>
      <li>Will need training, as new employees will have never seen the software before</li>

  <li>Do interpreters produce a binary?
    <ul>
      <li>False. They run the code line by line, statement by statement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which method is faster to run code and why?
    <ul>
      <li>Compiled code is faster compared to interpreted code at the “running” stage, as the program is converted to a binary which a computer understands.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not accept:</strong> Interpreted as you need to wait for the compiler to compile a binary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Simplify \(\overline{(\overline A+B)}+\overline{(\overline A+C)}\)
    <ul>
      <li>Use De Morgan’s Law: \((\overline{\overline A}.\overline B)+(\overline{\overline A}.\overline C)\)</li>
      <li>Use Double Complement Law: \((A.\overline B)+(A.\overline C)\)</li>
      <li>Use the Distributive Law: \(A.(\overline B+\overline C)\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
