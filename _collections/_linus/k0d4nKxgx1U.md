# Berkel
So today we have recieved a giant package in the mail, and it's huge and it's addressed to Channel Super Fun
Freaking heavy man holy crap

# Luke
How did they even get this thing

# Berkel
Ewwww

So we've played with the Anki, I think it's the Anki Overdrive, and it was pretty fun, it was like a little Bluetooth race track

# Taran
You set up the track and like each car has a weapon and you shoot at people, I guess it's kind of like Mario Kart...

# Berkel
But this looks like they've sent a lot more pieces.
What the hell? Look!
_Dennis is found stuck inside the box_

# Dennis
_oh my god_

I'm back

**airhorn**
**The Channel Super Fun intro plays**

# Berkel
See ya

# Dennis
Okay okay I'm going home

# Berkel
Nice knowing you

# Dennis
_oh god_

# Berkel
Bye bye!
You can stay for the game and then we'll ship you back after

# Dennis
_aaa_
_woah oah oaah_

**A pile of Anki Overdrive track pieces in their packaging falls to the ground, box by box**

# Berkel
Last time we made the little track in the workshop
What... what do we want to do this time?
We've got a tonne of pieces.

# Taran
We want to make the biggest track we possibly can.

# Berkel
What would you call that track?

# Taran
_i dunno_

**In slow motion**
m e g a t r a c k?

# Berkel
What do you think? Megatrack?

# Dennis
I don't know.
I just got back on my shipment.
