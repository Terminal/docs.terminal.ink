title: 4.6.4 Logic Gates
import:
  - mathjax
---

Logic Gates are electrical components that are the foundation of all of computing. Computers rely on logic gates made out of transistors to perform actions. These logic gates are based off of boolean algebra, where the only values can be either a `1` or a `0`, representing an `on` or `off` state.

Boolean | State
------- | -----
1       | On
0       | Off

Because the boolean number system has only two digits for counting, conversion is required when converting numbers to and from decimal, our system of counting.

## NOT Gate
A `NOT` gate toggles the state of the input.
If the input is off, the output is on.
If the input is on, the output is off.

1 | 0

## AND Gate
An `AND` gate checks if both inputs are on.
If both inputs are both on, the output will be on.

A | B | Q
- | - | -
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

## OR Gate
An `OR` gate turns on when any input is on.
When one or more inputs are on, the output will be on.
