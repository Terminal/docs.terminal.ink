title: 4.6.1 Hardware and software
---

## 4.6.1.1 Relationship between hardware and software
A computer system is made up of two parts:

- Hardware
- Software

Hardware is something that can be physically picked up/touched.
Software is the applications and programming instructions which tell your hardware what to do.

Without software, hardware is very limited.
Without hardware, software is next to useless.

Only with both, can the potential be fully realised.

### Software
There are two types of software

- System Software
- Application Software

System software is the operating system, utility programs and drivers.
It is effectively the 'software platform' for application software.

Application software is our "every day" software such as a word processing program, graphics maniplulation programs and web browsers.
Application software runs 'on top' of the system software that supports it.
For example, a game may use OpenGL to send instructions to the display drivers to display an image.
Types of application software include:

- General purpose application software
  - Software that is not written for any particular type of business
  - Word Processors
  - Spreadsheet Programs
  - It is relatively cheap
  - Readily available
  - Great support
  - Less bugs as more people have tested the software
- Special purpose application software
  - Software written for a defined purpose
  - Accountancy software
  - SIMS
- Bespoke application software
  - Written when a company requires a piece of software to peform a very specific task
  - Website backend
  - Expensive to develop
  - Hard to debug
  + Does not have un-necessary parts
  + Once it's working, they own the rights to it
