## 4.5.3.1 Bits and bytes
A bit is a fundamental unit of information that can either store a 0 or a 1.
Computers cannot just deal with one bit at a time, as they are too small.
Computers usually deal with 8 bits at a time.

Unit               | Bits | Number of Values
------------------ | ---- | -------------------
bit                | 1    | \\(2^1 = 1\\)
nibble             | 4    | \\(2^4 = 16\\)
byte               | 8    | \\(2^8 = 256\\)
word               | 16   | \\(2^{16} = 65536\\)
dword (doubleword) | 32   | \\(2^{32} = 4294967296\\)
qword (quadword)   | 64   | \\(2^{64} = 9223372036854775807\\)

## 4.5.3.2 Units
Quantities of bytes can be described using binary or decimal prefixes.

Decimal Name | Bytes         | Binary Name | Bytes
------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ------------
Kilobyte     | \\(10^3\\)    | Kibibyte    | \\(2^{10}\\)
Megabyte     | \\(10^6\\)    | Mebibyte    | \\(2^{20}\\)
Gigabyte     | \\(10^9\\)    | Gibibyte    | \\(2^{30}\\)
Terabyte     | \\(10^{12}\\) | Tebibyte    | \\(2^{40}\\)
