## Open Architecture Networking
The Internet uses an open architecture networking.
Designers are free to design networks however they want.
All these networks can communcicate over the internet.

Each network is connected to the Internet through a router gateway.

Within national boundaries, networks belonging to a large business or a unversity connect directly to the national backbone,
whereas smaller organisations or individuals connect via an ISP, who are then connected to the backbone

## Routers
Routers are special switches that recieve incoming packets of data along one link and send that as an outgoing packet to another link.
Each packet contains the IP of the destination, which is used to find the destination and to choose the right outgoing link.
Each network is connect to the Internet through a router gateway.
A router gateway allows one network to be connected to another so that packets from one network can be translated into a form which is compatible to the next
A gateway is only necessary when the communication channels on either side of it use different link layer protocols.
If the channel uses the same link layer protocol, the machine is just a router.

## Gateways
Gateways regulate traffic between two dissimilar networks, while routers regulate traffic between similar networks.
A gateway is only necessary when the communcation channels on either side of it use differernt link layer protocols.
If the channel uses the same link layer, a router is used.

## Examples of networks

Label | Expansion
----- | ----------
WAN   | Wide Area Network
MAN   | Metropolitan Area Network
CAN   | Campus Area Network
LAN   | Local Area Network
WLAN  | Wireless Local Area Network
PAN   | Personal Area Network

### Topologies

Thing    | Explaination
-------- | -------------------
Bus      | All the computers are connected to the same wire, called the backbone
Ring     | All the computers are linked in a ring, and a token is passed around
Star     | All the computers are connected to a switch
Mesh     | All the computers are connected to each other
Wireless | Uses electromagnetic radiation to transmit via the power of a WLAN

### Intranet
The Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organisation,
and is only accessed via the members of the organisation.
